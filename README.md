### *Abstract*  
The project "Kais FundChain" is a secure and transparent fundraising application that utilizes blockchain technology to manage user deposits. The application is designed to ensure the integrity and security of financial transactions through the use of Ethereum smart contracts and blockchain simulation tools such as Ganache. The frontend is built using Flutter, and the backend leverages Django Rest Framework to handle APIs and user management. Local data storage is implemented using SQLite.

### *Introduction*  
Fundraising systems often face challenges like lack of transparency, trust, and data security. "Kais FundChain" addresses these issues by integrating blockchain technology into the fundraising process. The project features an admin panel for monitoring user activity and predefined user roles, ensuring structured management and enhanced security.  

The primary goal is to combine traditional fundraising practices with cutting-edge blockchain technology to ensure immutable, transparent, and secure transactions.
